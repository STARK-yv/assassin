<h>WHO ARE ASSASSIN'S?</h>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/om.png" alt="ASSASSIN" style="width:800px;height:500px;"></p>
<p>
  The legends are based on the Nizari Ismailis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizari_Ismaili_state"  target="_blank">�</a>a breakaway group from the
  Ismaili branch of Shia Islam <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Shia_Islam"  target="_blank">�</a>that occupied a string of mountain castles in
  Syria and Iran from the end of the 11th century until the Mongol conquests
  in the middle of the 13th

<h>The Remarkable History of the Original Assassins</h>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/assas.jpg" alt="ASSASSIN" style="width:800px;height:500px;"></p>
<p>The first group of assassins to be found in the historical record is
  that of the Hashshashin who operated in Persia, Syria, and Turkey,
  eventually spreading throughout the Middle East. They assassinated
  their political and financial foes until the organization met its own
  demise in the middle of the 13th century.
  When we think of an assassin we see a figure lurking and waiting in
  the shadows, killing for dark political reasons, with little thought
  for passions of the heart or interest in money. And that isn�t far
  off from how the actual assassins operated in the 11th through 13th centuries.

<h>PURPOSE</h>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/er.jpg" alt="ASSASSIN" style="width:800px;height:500px;"></p>
<p>
An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military
motives. It is an act that may be done for financial gain, to avenge a
grievance, from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety, or because of a
military, security, insurgent or secret police group's command to carry
 out the homicide

<h>TRAINING</h>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Build your body for efficiency</li>
<p>Swim half a mile or more: for when you need to dive underwater to
   avoid capture and swim to a more secluded location.
   Run at top speed for 200 yards or more: for when you are spotted and
   need to run away to avoid capture.
   Jump over obstacles higher than your waist: for when you need to
   climb buildings, hurdle obstacles while being chased, and more.
   Do fifteen to twenty pull ups: for when you need to scale buildings to
   stalk your prey from above.
   Dip between parallel bars twenty-five times or more: to hoist yourself
   up onto ledges or to push yourself away from one wall to leap to another.</p>
  <li>Master your environment</li>
<p>Instead, I want to talk about analyzing your environment � often times
  you�ll be in a situation where you�ll need to get creative with your
  surroundings in order to succeed.  Let�s say you need to assassinate a
  target on the other side of a building.</p>
  <li>Move softly</li>
<p>It�s time to trade in those clunky running shoes and change up your running
  style � pick up a pair of Vibram Five Fingers (or even go barefoot) and learn
  to run barefoot � your calves will HATE you for a few weeks but your knees,
  hips, back, and other joints will love you.  Get good at running silently by
  landing softly, and pick surfaces that hide your footsteps � grass is optimal.</p>
<li>Be quick about it</li>
<p>You need to become quick like an assassin by training with purpose. If you�re
  at the gym or training in your backyard, stop chatting on the phone.  Don�t
  spend hours on a treadmill watching Oprah.  Don�t waste any extra time
  sets.  Get into that gym, get your workout done quickly, and get the hell out
  of there.  Set a timer and tell yourself that you need to be done with your
  workout in 45 minutes or less.</p>
<li>Join a Brotherhood</li>
<p>The Assassins Brotherhood is underground network of people working to help
  each other accomplish goals. Although most assassinations are solo missions,
  assassins can often work together to eliminate a target.  When not on a
  mission, students of the brotherhood learn from those more advanced and
  experienced than them.  The more senior assassins help put together teams
  that maximize the chance for success in every mission.  Assassins looks
  out for their brothers (and sisters) by helping out in any way possible.</p>
